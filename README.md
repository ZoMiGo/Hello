# Hello Messenger
Send Message to your friends and family for free. HELLO uses your phone’s internet connection to send messages so you can avoid SMS fees.

Talk to your friends and family for free*, even if they’re in another country. HELLO Calling uses your phone’s Internet connection, instead of your cell plan’s voice minutes, so you don’t have to worry about expensive calling charges.

Send photos ,audio notes and videos on HELLO instantly. You can even capture the moments that matter to you most with a built-in camera.

Groups to keep in touch

Keep in touch with the groups of people that matter the most, like your family or coworkers. With group chats, you can share messages, photos, and videos with up to 300 people at once. You can also name your group, mute or customize notifications, and more.

Security by Default

Some of your most personal moments are shared on Hello Messenger, which is why we built end-to-end encryption into the latest versions of our app. When end-to-end encrypted, your messages and calls are secured so only you and the person you're communicating with can read or listen to them, and nobody in between, not even Hello Messenger.

Say What's On Your Mind

Sometimes, your voice says it all. With just one tap you can record a Voice Message, perfect for a quick hello or a longer story.

Document Sharing Made Easy

Send PDFs, documents, spreadsheets, slideshows and more, without the hassle of email or file sharing apps. You can send documents up to 50 MB, so it's easy to get what you need over to who you want.

Send photos ,audio notes and videos on HELLO instantly. You can even capture the moments that matter to you most with a built-in camera.
